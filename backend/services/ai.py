Format your response as exactly 3 distinct suggestions.
Make each suggestion specific to the actual goals described.
Start each suggestion with an action verb.
Include specific details from the goals.

Example format:
"Start working on [specific goal] by [specific action]..."
"Focus on improving [specific aspect] of [specific goal]..."
"Prioritize [specific task] to achieve [specific goal]..."

Avoid generic advice. Make sure each suggestion references specific goals and details."""
